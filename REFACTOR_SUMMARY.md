# NLP Server Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the NLP MCP server to support text analysis for both entity extraction and summarization, in addition to the existing web page analysis capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Type Safety
- Added proper type hints throughout the codebase using `typing` module
- Fixed return type annotations for all functions
- Added `Optional[str]` for functions that can return `None`
- Used `Dict[str, Any]` and `Dict[str, str]` for proper type safety

### 2. New Text Analysis Functions
- **`summarize_text(text: str, num_sentences: int = 3) -> Dict[str, str]`**
  - Summarizes raw text input using TF-IDF based approach
  - Returns a dictionary with the summary text

- **`extract_text_entities(text: str, top_k: int = 5) -> Dict[str, Any]`**
  - Extracts named entities from raw text using spaCy
  - Returns entities with text, type, and count information

- **`analyze_text_sentiment(text: str, threshold: float = 0.5) -> Dict[str, Any]`**
  - Performs aspect-based sentiment analysis on raw text
  - Returns paragraph and sentence-level sentiment analysis

### 3. New API Endpoints
- **`POST /text-summary/`** - Summarize raw text
- **`POST /text-entities/`** - Extract entities from raw text  
- **`POST /text-sentiment/`** - Analyze sentiment of raw text

### 4. Updated MCP Server Configuration
- Added new operation IDs to the FastApiMCP configuration:
  - `summarize_text`
  - `extract_text_entities`

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed line length issues (79 character limit)
- Improved error handling and type annotations
- Enhanced documentation with proper docstrings
- Removed unused imports

## Testing Results

### Text Summarization
✅ **Working**: Successfully summarizes text using TF-IDF approach
```
Input: "Natural language processing is a fascinating field..."
Output: {"summary": "Natural language processing is a fascinating field..."}
```

### Text Entity Extraction
✅ **Working**: Successfully extracts named entities
```
Input: "Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company..."
Output: {"entities": [{"text": "Apple Inc.", "type": "ORG", "count": 1}, ...]}
```

### Text Sentiment Analysis
✅ **Working**: Successfully analyzes sentiment at paragraph and sentence level
```
Input: "I absolutely love this new smartphone!..."
Output: {"paragraph_sentiments": {...}}
```

## Available Endpoints

### Web Page Analysis
- `GET /summary/` - Summarize web page content
- `GET /sentiment/` - Analyze sentiment of web page content
- `GET /entities/` - Extract entities from web page content

### Text Analysis (NEW)
- `POST /text-summary/` - Summarize raw text
- `POST /text-sentiment/` - Analyze sentiment of raw text
- `POST /text-entities/` - Extract entities from raw text

### Utility
- `GET /nlp-readme/` - Get documentation content

## MCP Operations

The server now exposes the following MCP operations:
- `get_summary` - Summarize web page content
- `analyze_sentiment_from_url` - Analyze sentiment of web page content
- `analyze_sentiment_from_text` - Analyze sentiment of raw text
- `extract_entities` - Extract entities from web page content
- `summarize_text` - Summarize raw text (NEW)
- `extract_text_entities` - Extract entities from raw text (NEW)

## Usage Examples

### Text Summarization
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/text-summary/?text=Your%20text%20here&num_sentences=2"
```

### Text Entity Extraction
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/text-entities/?text=Apple%20Inc.%20is%20headquartered%20in%20Cupertino&top_k=5"
```

### Text Sentiment Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/text-sentiment/?text=I%20love%20this%20product!&threshold=0.3"
```

## Dependencies
All existing dependencies remain the same:
- FastAPI
- BeautifulSoup
- TextBlob
- spaCy
- NLTK
- requests

## Next Steps
1. The server is now ready for production use
2. All text analysis capabilities are fully functional
3. Both web page and raw text analysis are supported
4. MCP integration is complete with all operations exposed

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The refactoring has been successfully completed with all new text analysis features working correctly.
